This is a [Next.js v12.1](https://nextjs.org/) project template bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It contains other libraries and tools such as:

- (Typescript)[https://www.typescriptlang.org/] for setting types for Javascript.
- (TailwindCSS v3.0.23)[https://tailwindcss.com/] for utility-based styling.
- (styled-components)[https://styled-components.com/] for a more customized approach of styling your components.
- (styled-normalize)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-normalize] for normalizing CSS accross browsers.
- (Prettier)[https://prettier.io/] for basic code formatting every file save.

These are the basic tools to get you started on developing a fuctional web app with React without having to do all the setup by yourself. Happy coding!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Maximizing Development

To use the tools effectively, use a code editor that supports snippets, auto completes, and tooltip docs. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is highly recommended which gives you a lot of extensions useful when coding. Here are some very useful extensions to have:

- JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly
- ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets
- Auto Import - ES6, TS, JSX, TSX
- Auto Rename Tag
- Add jsdoc comments
- Better Comments
- Paste JSON as Code
- Prettier - Code formatter
- Quokka.js
- vscode-styled-components
- GitLens
- Color Picker

It's also worth mentioning to [create your own snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) for basic components, hooks, and context functions to save coding time.

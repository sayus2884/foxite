Foxite is a React project boilerplate that leverages features from Typescript, Next JS, MUI, and Tailwind CSS so you can focus on building your web app with an already built foundation and deploy it with little to no hassle.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
or
```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start developing by modifying `./src/pages/index.tsx`.

## Maximizing Development Experience

To use the tools effectively, use a code editor that supports snippets, auto completes, and tooltip docs. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is highly recommended which gives you a lot of extensions useful when coding. Here are some very useful extensions to have:

- JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly
- ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets
- Auto Import - ES6, TS, JSX, TSX
- Auto Rename Tag
- Add jsdoc comments
- Better Comments
- Paste JSON as Code
- Prettier - Code formatter
- Quokka.js
- vscode-styled-components
- GitLens
- Color Picker
